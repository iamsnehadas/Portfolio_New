            <p>I am Sneha Das, currently a fourth year student pursuing B.Tech. in Information Technology 
                from Jalpaiguri Goverment Engineering College. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I have recently been selected in the prestigious SWE fellowship program offered by 
                Headstarter AI.
                <br>
                <br>
                I have been a mentee of Codess.Cafe since April,2022 and am an active member of the Coders' Club of our college. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I am an enthusiastic programmer, with experiences in various programming languages, like, C++, C, Python, 
                Java etc. I am also a frontend web developer and am currently learning JavaScript. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I also really love to create different web-designs, like, various website and application logo, user interfaces etc. through softwares 
                like Canva and figma.

            <p>To talk about my hobbies and passions, 
                I am an avid reader and love to read books of both fiction and non-fiction genre. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I am also an artist and I absolutely love painting in my free time. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I am also very passionate about learning new languages, as I believe learning different languages can truly diversify 
                one's understanding of the world. I already know Bengali, English, Hindi, basic Sanskrit and am currently on my way to 
                learn German, which is my fifth language! 
                <br>
                <br>
                I love to spend my free time with story books, music and maybe a cup a coffee.
